# mHydyS

`mHydyS` (pronounced _"Hades"_; the _"m"_ is silent ðŸ˜€) is a one-/two-dimensional (magneto-)hydrodynamics shock code for the purpose of simulating shocks with ions and neutrals, with possible radiative heating and cooling.

This code is created as part of the Master's thesis research project at the University of Cologne.

# Description

The code is written entirely in Python3 and employs a finite volume subgrid model (Eulerian) with a structured uniform grid. The simulation allows for periodic or outlet boundary conditions. It also allows for magnetic fields in one dimension with the magnetic permeability set to one for simplicity. The solution in the grid is updated in parallel.

### Spatial discretisation

The space in the simulation is discretised via a uniform Cartesian grid, and employs various reconstruction methods with primitive variables as part of the subgrid modelling: the piecewise constant method (Godunov, 1959), the piecewise linear method with a _minmod_ slope limiter (Derigs et al., 2018), and the piecewise parabolic method (Felker & Stone, 2017) with cell faces limiters (Colella et al., 2011) and parabolic interpolations limiters (Colella et al., 2011; McCorquodale & Colella, 2011). The parabolic reconstruction method by McCorquodale & Colella (2011) also includes a slope flattener (Colella, 1990) and artificial viscosity as additional dissipation mechanisms to suppress oscillations at strong shocks.

### Time discretisation

The time in the simulation uses a method-of-lines approach, thus the time can be discretised and treated separately from the spatial component. Higher-order temporal discretisation methods can be employed to match the higher-order spatial components used. In the following, the strong-stability preserving (SSP) variants of the (explicit) Runge-Kutta (RK) methods are denoted as SSPRK (_i_,_j_), where _i_ and _j_ refers to _i_-stage and the _j_-th order iterative method respectively. Several SSPRK variants are included for this simulation, with the SSPRK (2,2), SSPRK (3,3) (Shu & Osher, 1988), SSPRK (5,3) (Spiteri & Ruuth, 2002), and SSPRK (5,4) (Gottlieb et al., 2009) methods. The ''classic'' RK4 or the Forward Euler method can also be used.

### Scheme and Riemann solver

Due to the nature of the finite volume method and the discretisation of space in the grid, a Riemann problem is created at each interface between consecutive cells, with each cell containing the subgrid profile. In this code, approximate Riemann solvers are used (linear and non-linear) in order to perform the conservative update.
The Local Lax-Friedrichs (LLF) scheme (LeVeque, 1992) is an approximate linearised Riemann solver (i.e. the method aims to find an _exact_ solution to the _linearised_ or _approximate_ version of the (magneto-)hydrodynamic equations) that is very stable and robust, however it is highly dissipative and only first-order. The fluxes and the Jacobian matrices are calculated using the interpolated interfaces, with the Jacobian matrix using an average of these interfaces (Cargo & Gallice, 1997).
The code also allows for the Lax-Wendroff scheme (Lax & Wendroff, 1960), which is another approximate linearised Riemann solver but it is second-order.
The main issue with linear schemes is that the schemes will cause spurrious oscillations, according to Godunov's Theorem (Godunov, 1954). Non-linear Riemann solvers, that attempt to restore some form of the eigenstructure, are therefore implemented into the code.
The HLLC Riemann solver (Fleischmann et. al., 2020) attempts to restore the contact discontinuity wave while tracing the rarefaction and shock wave Riemann invariants, thus it provides a better resolution albeit with some dissipation.
Riemann solvers that attempt to derive the flux from the full eigenstructure (not exact) are also included in the code, such as the entropy-stable flux (Derigs et al., 2016) and the modified Osher-Solomon flux (Dumbser & Toro, 2011), but they are incomplete and run into errors frequently.

### Hydrodynamical tests

Hydrodynamical tests in place are the Sod shock tube test (Sod, 1978), the Sedov blast test (Sedov, 1946), simple advection wave tests (Gaussian, _sin_-curve, square), the Shu-Osher shock tube problem (Shu & Osher, 1989), and five shock tube tests from Toro (Toro, 1999, p.225).
An additional magnetohydrodynamics test is included (Ryu & Jones, 1995).
Analytical solutions for the Sod shock test (Pfrommer et al., 2006), Gaussian wave test and the _sin_-wave test are overplotted in the saved plots. The solution error (L1 error norm) is also determined when the _sin-wave_ or Gaussian test is run.

# Installation

Clone this repository onto your local machine, and navigate to the cloned repository. Run _`python3 static/setup.py`_ to install a venv (_.shock_venv_) in the home directory. This will also install the requirements for the project in the venv. _It is highly recommended to always run Python projects in separate virtual environments._

# Usage

Edit your parameters in _`settings.py`_ and run _`python3 simulate.py`_. Alternatively, the code is also able to accept CLI arguments, e.g., _`python3 simulate.py --config==sod --cells==128`_.
