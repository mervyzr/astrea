# mHydyS
`mHydyS` (pronounced *"Hades"*; the *"m"* is silent ðŸ˜€) is a one-dimensional (magneto-)hydrodynamics shock code for the purpose of simulating shocks with ions and neutrals, with possible radiative heating and cooling.

This code is created as part of the Master's thesis research project at the University of Cologne.

# Description
The code is written entirely in Python3 and employs a (Eulerian) finite volume subgrid model with a structured uniform grid and a method-of-lines approach. The simulation allows for periodic or outlet boundary conditions. It also allows for magnetic fields in one dimension with the magnetic permeability set to one.

### Spatial discretisation
The space in the simulation is discretised via a uniform Cartesian grid, and employs various reconstruction methods with primitive variables as part of the subgrid modelling: the piecewise constant method (Godunov, 1959), the piecewise linear method with a *minmod* slope limiter (Derigs et al., 2018), and the piecewise parabolic method (Felker & Stone, 2017) with cell faces limiters (Colella et al., 2011) and parabolic interpolations limiters (Colella et al., 2011; McCorquodale & Colella, 2011). The parabolic reconstruction method by McCorquodale & Colella (2011) also includes a slope flattener (Colella, 1990) and artificial viscosity as additional dissipation mechanisms to suppress oscillations at strong shocks.

### Time discretisation
The time in the simulation can be discretised and treated separately from the spatial component (because of the method-of-lines approach). Higher-order temporal discretisation methods can be employed to match the higher-order spatial components used. In the following, the strong-stability preserving (SSP) variants of the (explicit) Runge-Kutta (RK) methods are denoted as SSPRK (*i*,*j*), where *i* and *j* refers to *i*-stage and the *j*-th order iterative method respectively. Several SSPRK variants are included for this simulation, with the SSPRK (2,2), SSPRK (3,3) (Shu & Osher, 1988), SSPRK (5,3) (Spiteri & Ruuth, 2002), and SSPRK (5,4) (Gottlieb et al., 2009) methods. The ''classic'' RK4 or the Forward Euler method can also be used.

### Flux and Riemann solver
The Local Lax-Friedrichs (LLF) method (LeVeque, 1992) is used for solving the Riemann problem at each interface for all reconstruction methods, although this method is highly dissipative and only first-order accurate. The LLF method is an approximate linearised Riemann solver, i.e., the method aims to find an *exact* solution to the *linearised* or *approximate* version of the (magneto-)hydrodynamic equations. The fluxes and the Jacobian matrices are calculated using the interpolated interfaces, with the Jacobian matrix using an average of these interfaces (Cargo & Gallice, 1997).

### Hydrodynamical tests
Hydrodynamical tests in place are the Sod shock tube test (Sod, 1978), the Sedov blast test (Sedov, 1946), simple advection wave tests (Gaussian, *sin*-curve, square), the Shu-Osher shock tube problem (Shu & Osher, 1989), and five shock tube tests from Toro (Toro, 1999, p.225). An additional magnetohydrodynamics test is included (Ryu & Jones, 1995). Analytical solutions for the Sod shock test (Pfrommer et al., 2006), Gaussian wave test and the *sin*-wave test are overplotted in the saved plots. The solution error (L1 error norm) is also determined when the *sin-wave* or Gaussian test is run.

# Installation
Clone this repository onto your local machine, and navigate to the cloned repository. Run *`python3 setup.py`* to install a venv (*.shock_venv*) in the home directory. This will also install the requirements for the project in the venv. *It is recommended to run Python projects in virtual environments.*

# Usage
Edit your parameters in *`settings.py`* and run *`simulate.py`* (preferably in the venv).
