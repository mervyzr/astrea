# mHydyS
mHydyS (pronounced *"Hades"*; the *"m"* is silent ðŸ˜€) is a one-dimensional (magneto-)hydrodynamics shock code for the purpose of simulating shocks with ions and neutrals, with possible radiative heating and cooling.

This code is created as part of the Master's thesis research project at the University of Cologne.

# Description
The code is written entirely in Python3 and employs a finite volume (Eulerian) subgrid model with a fixed evenly-spaced grid. The simulation allows for periodic or outlet boundary conditions. It also allows for magnetic fields in one dimension with the magnetic permeability set to one.

### Spatial discretisation
The simulation employs a method-of-lines approach with primitive variables, and can currently perform various reconstruction methods: the piecewise constant method (Godunov, 1959), the piecewise linear method (Derigs et al., 2018) with a *minmod* limiter (Roe, 1986), and the piecewise parabolic method (Felker & Stone, 2017) with face value limiters (Colella et al., 2011) and parabolic interpolations (Colella et al., 2011; Peterson & Hammett, 2013). The reconstruction methods also have the possibility of implementing a slope flattener (Saltzman, 1994), although this feature is not fully tested.

### Time discretisation
The time in the simulation is discretised and evolved with iterative methods. In the following, the strong-stability preserving (SSP) variants of the (explicit) Runge-Kutta (RK) methods are denoted as SSPRK (*i*,*j*), where *i* and *j* refers to *i*-stage and the *j*-th order iterative method respectively. Several SSPRK variants are included for this simulation, with the SSPRK (2,2), SSPRK (3,3) (Shu & Osher, 1988), SSPRK (5,3) (Spiteri & Ruuth, 2002), and SSPRK (5,4) (Gottlieb et al., 2009) methods. The ''classic'' RK4 or the Forward Euler method can also be used.

### Riemann solver
The Local Lax-Friedrichs method (LeVeque, 1992) is used for solving the Riemann problem at each interface for all reconstruction methods, although this method is highly dissipative and only first-order accurate.

### Hydrodynamical tests
Hydrodynamical tests in place are the Sod shock tube test (Sod, 1978), the Sedov blast test (Sedov, 1946), a Gaussian wave test, a ''sin-wave'' test, a square-wave advection test, the Shu-Osher shock tube problem (Shu & Osher, 1989), and five shock tube tests from Toro's book (Toro, 1999, p.225). Analytical solutions for the Sod shock test (Pfrommer et al., 2006) and the Gaussian wave test are also overplotted when they are run. The solution error (L1 error norm) is also determined when the ''sin-wave'' or Gaussian test is run.

# Installation
Clone this repository onto your local machine, and navigate to the cloned repository. Run *`python3 setup.py`* to install a venv (*.mHydyS_venv*) in the home directory. This will also install the requirements for the project in the venv.

# Usage
Edit your parameters in *`settings.py`* and run *`simulate.py`* (preferably in the venv).
